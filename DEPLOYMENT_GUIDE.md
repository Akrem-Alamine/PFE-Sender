## 🛠️ Next Steps (Optional)

To use with real recipients:
1. Replace mock data in `data/recipients.csv` with real recipient information
2. Update email addresses to real target addresses
3. Redeploy to GCP
4. Monitor via GCP logs and status endpoints

The system is designed to handle hundreds of recipients and will automatically cycle through them during business hours.
